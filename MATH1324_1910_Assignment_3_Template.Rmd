# INTRODUCTION

This year, the 7th Annual **World Happiness Report** was released on
March 20 on the occasion of International Day of Happiness by the
Sustainable Development Solutions Network of the United Nations in
collaboration with Gallup and the Ernesto Illy Foundation.

-   It is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks
    156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be,
    on a scale of zero to 10, from the worst possible life to the best
    possible life.

-   The Happiness Index ranks countries on the basis of questions from
    the Gallup World poll and the results are correlated to income,
    healthy life longevity, generosity, freedom, social support and
    absence of corruption.

While GDP per capita remains to be a deciding statistic for the
Happiness Index, questions still arise: does increased GDP indicate a
higher average happiness for the nations? Even when people are
relatively better off than before, why has their happiness not
increased? Clearly the correlation between happiness and wealth is
subject to examination. This very question is explored in this report
based on statistical investigation using linear regression model and
efficient data visualization in R.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

**Question:** Can GDP per capita of a country be used to determine the
happiness of its people ?

**Methods:**

-   Linear regression model is applied to examine the relationship
    between two selected variables.

-   Hypothesis testing is performed for the overall linear reggresion
    model and parameters ($α$ and $β$).

-   Assumptions for independence, linearity, normality of residuals,
    homoscedasticity are made.

-   Pearson correlation coefficient is applied to measure the strength
    of the linear relationship.

# ANALYSIS OF DATA SOURCE

**1. UNSDSN :** The information was gathered from a single direct
primary source: The World Happiness Report produced by the United
Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UNSDSN) in
partnership with the Ernesto Illy Foundation. While the possibility of a
bias is always possible, these companies likely stand to profit more
from accurate international information pertaining to people's desires,
so it seems very unlikely that an agenda is being pushed meaning the
data is very likely accurate.

**2. Gallup, Inc.:** Gallup, Inc. is an American analytics and advisory
company known for its public opinion polls conducted worldwide. The
happiness score was received from Gallup's data, which was done by
performing randomised phone surveys (that were still representative of
the overall demographics of the country above 15 years old) in countries
where that was a proven method. In countries where it wasn't or where
phone lines weren't readily available country-wide, face to face surveys
were conducted. Phone surveys were 15-30 minutes, face to face ones
30-60 minutes usually.The information is unclear on how many people were
interviewed.

-   The dataset consists of 156 observations (representing 156
    countries) and 11 variables.

-   Variables *GDP per capita*, *Social support*, *Healthy life
    expectancy*, *Freedom to make life choices*, *Generosity*,
    *Perceptions of corruption* and *Dystopia* are taken from the
    population (by survey) to determine a nation's happiness score.

# EXPLORING DATASET

-   *Happiness Score :* How would you rate your happiness on a scale of
    0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest?
-   *Economy :* GDP per capita
-   Variables *Country* ,*Happiness score* and *Explained by: GDP per
    Capita* are subset to a new data frame and column names are changed
    to **Happiness Score** and **Economy** to make the data easier to
    read.

```{r}
#setwd("~/Project") #set working directory

#read data and make columns readable
Happiness_Index_19 <- read_excel ("Chapter2OnlineData.xls", sheet = 2)
names(Happiness_Index_19) <-make.names(names(Happiness_Index_19),unique = TRUE)

happiness<- Happiness_Index_19[,c(1,2,6)] #subset the data

colnames(happiness)[c(2,3)]<- c("Happiness_Score", "Economy") #change column names
head(happiness)
```

# INITIAL VISUALISATION

Scatter plot is used to visualise the relationship between Economy and
Happiness Score. It depicts that as GDP increases, the Happiness Score
also increases, indicating a positive relationship.

```{r}
happiness %>% plot(Happiness_Score ~ Economy, data=., col="red", 
                   main = "Happiness Score by GDP per capita",
                   xlab = "Economy",ylab = "Happiness Index Score")
```

# DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Best line of fit : $Happiness~Score = 3.3991 + 2.2185 * Economy$

```{r}
#use lm() function to fit the linear regression model
happiness_model<- lm(Happiness_Score ~ Economy, data=happiness)
happiness_model %>% summary()
```

# HYPOTHESIS TESTING : $F$-TEST FOR OVERALL MODEL

$$H_0:Data~does~not~fit~the~linear~regression~model$$
$$H_A:Data~fits~the~linear~regression~model$$

```{r}
happiness_model %>% summary() %>% coef()
```

-   We found $p$\< 0.001. So, we reject $H_0$, as the p-value is less
    than the 0.05 level of significance. There is statistically
    significant evidence that the data fits a linear regression model.

-   $R^2$-statistic is reported from the model as **0.6303**.**63%** of
    variability in the happiness score can be explained by a linear
    relationship with economy. Higher value of $R^2$ reflects the
    goodness of fit for linear regression, i.e., the line fits the data
    good.

# HYPOTHESIS TESTING : MODEL PARAMETERS ($α$)

$$Null~Hypothesis:~H_0:α=0$$ $$Alternate~Hypothesis:~H_A:α≠0$$

-   The intercept is reported as **3.3991**. This hypothesis is tested
    using a $t$ statistic, reported as **t = 25.12, p\<0.001**.

-   The constant is statistically significant at 0.05 significance
    level. So, there is statistically siginificant evidence that the
    constant is not 0.

In order to confirm that p \< 0.001, 95% CI is calculated for $α$ by
using `confint()` function:

```{r}
happiness_model %>% confint()
```

-   95% CI for $α$ is reported to be **[3.132, 3.666]**.

-   $H_0 :α = 0$ is clearly not captured by this interval, therefore, it
    is rejected.

# HYPOTHESIS TESTING : MODEL PARAMETERS ($β$)

$$Null~Hypothesis:~H_0:β=0$$ $$Alternate~Hypothesis:~H_A:β≠0$$

-   Slope of the regression line was reported as $β = 2.2185$ . This
    means that one unit increase in GDP is related to an average
    increase in happiness score of **2.2185** units, i.e., a positive
    change.

-   The slope is tested using a $t$ statistic, reported as **t = 16.205,
    p\<0.001**.

-   Since the slope is statistically significant at 0.05 level, there is
    statistically siginificant evidence that $β≠0$.

-   `confint()` function used in previous slide shows the 95% CI for
    slope to be **[1.948, 2.489]**. As the 95% CI does not capture
    $H_0$, it is rejected.

# ASSUMPTIONS

1.  **Independence :** All the survey results are independent of each
    other and there are no multiple measurements for the same country.

2.  **Linearity :** We have checked and confirmed the linearity in the
    begining of the report by using scatter plot. The scatter plot shows
    a positive relationship : as GDP increases, so does the happiness
    scores.

3.  **Normality of residuals and Homoscedasticity :** The `plot()`
    function is used to obtain a series of plots for checking the
    diagnostics of a fitted regression model in the following slides.

# TESTING ASSUMPTIONS : RESIDUALS VS. FITTED

-   The trend-line between fitted values and residuals is flat, which is
    a good indication that we are modelling a linear relationship.

-   The variability on y-axis is constant across the range of values on
    the x-axis and there is no distinct pattern in variablitiy,
    therefore, this is a sign of homoscedasticity or constant variance.

```{r}
happiness_model %>% plot(which =1)
```

# TESTING ASSUMPTIONS : NORMAL Q-Q

-   The residuals fall close to the line.

-   There are no major deviations from normality. So it is safe to
    assume that the residuals are approximately normally distributed.

```{r}
happiness_model %>% plot(which =2)
```

# TESTING ASSUMPTIONS : SCALE-LOCATION

-   The red line in the plot below is close to flat.

-   The variance in the square root of the standardised residuals is
    consistent across the fitted values. Therefore, this is a sign of
    homoscedasticity.

```{r}
happiness_model %>% plot(which =3)
```

# TESTING ASSUMPTIONS : RESIDUAL vs. LEVERAGE

-   There are no values that fall in the upper and lower right hand side
    of the plot beyond the red bands based on Cook's distances. Notably,
    the bands are not even visible in the plot below. So, there is no
    evidence of influential cases.

```{r}
happiness_model %>% plot(which =5)
```

# FINAL VISUALISATION

There is a statistically significant positive relationship between GDP
per capita and happiness score for a nation. The linear relationship can
be visualised using a plot as follows:

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(happiness$Country)){
happiness$Category <-
with (happiness, ifelse(Happiness_Score >= 7, "Extremely Happy",
ifelse(Happiness_Score >= 6 & Happiness_Score < 7,"Very Happy",
ifelse(Happiness_Score >= 5 & Happiness_Score < 6,"Happy","Not Happy")))) }

happiness$Category <- factor(happiness$Category,
levels = c("Extremely Happy","Very Happy","Happy","Not Happy"))

#colour points by happiness category
ggplot(data=happiness, aes(Economy, Happiness_Score, label= happiness$Country, color= happiness$Category)) + scale_color_discrete(name="Happiness Category") +
  
#add linear regression line
geom_line(data = fortify(happiness_model), aes(x = Economy, y = .fitted), col="blue") +
  
#add a layer for the plot type (points)
geom_point() + theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill="grey", size=0.5, linetype="solid")) +

# label the outliers
stat_dens2d_filter(geom = "text_repel", keep.fraction = 0.06, nudge_x=0.06, nudge_y=0.3) +
  
#add title , label axes  
labs(title="Happiness Index vs. GDP Per Capita of Countries", 
       y = "Happiness Index Score", x = "GDP Per Capita") +
  
#format title and axes labels for better readability
theme(plot.title = element_text(color="black", size=16, face="bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text( size=12, face="bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text( size=12, face="bold"))
```

# INTERPRETATION

**Findings :**

-   Independence and linearity was assumed, normality of residuals and
    homoscedasticity were maintained with no influential cases.
-   $R^2 = 0.63$ , i.e., 63% variability in **Happiness Score**
-   $F$-statistic $F(1,154) = 262.6$, $p < 0.001$
-   $α= 3.3991$ , $p < 0.001$, 95% CI **[3.132, 3.666]** ;
    $~β = 2.2185$, $p < 0.001$, 95% CI **[1.948, 2.489]**

**Decision :**

-   Overall model: Reject $H_0$
-   Intercept $α$ : Reject $H_0$
-   Slope $β$ : Reject $H_0$
-   Estimated regression equation is :
    $Happiness~Score = 3.3991 + 2.2185 * Economy$

# DISCUSSION

-   There was a statistically significant positive linear relationship
    between **Happiness Score** and **Economy**. Happiness score was
    estimated to explain up to 63% of the variability in economy. So,
    the estimated linear regression model can be used to predict the
    level of happiness of the countries that are not included in this
    report and compare the predicted happiness score with the actual
    happiness score.

-   Referring to the outliers, it can be noticed that countries having
    high GDP's like Qatar (**1.684**) and Hong Kong (**1.438**) don't
    qualify among the happiest nations (i.e., Extremely Happy category).
    Whereas, a less affluent country like Costa Rica with a much lesser
    GDP of **1.034** appears to be much happier indicating that wealth
    is not primarily an indication of happiness.

**Strengths:** Choices of significant variables for simple linear
regression model.

**Limitation:** Only one variable (**Economy**) from the dataset is used
to investigate whether the happiness score of each country can be
determined.

**Directions for future investigations :**

-   The simple regression model should further be used for comparision
    in 2-3 years.

-   The happiness score is recommended for determining the happiness
    level within a nation instead of comparing with other nations.
